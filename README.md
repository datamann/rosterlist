# Roster List
The purpose of this Roster List application is to let managers register work activities and schedule the workforce for these work activities.

# Use case #1
- As a manager, I need to be able to register workloads and workload locations scheduled in time and assign a workforce to these workloads.
- As a developer, I need to be able to query if a worker is scheduled to a workload at one specific time using an API.
